# DomainErrorsKotlin
This is an experiment to find a nice/clean/reusable way of managing errors from the domain layer on the presentation layer. The main point was avoiding exceptions. [PaNaVTEC](https://github.com/PaNaVTEC) and I had a discussion and implemented it [in Java](https://github.com/PaNaVTEC/DomainErrors). This is the version in Kotlin.
